2 Problem Statement
===================

  Underactuated flying vehicle that is more cost and energy efficient.


3 Motivation
============

  Modern Rocket uses 2 DOF revolute joint to turn the nozzle to control
  the thrust. Challenges are it has to resist a very high temperature
  and the joint need a large amount of energy to keep the nozzle in a
  specific direction.  Instead, a precisely controlled off-center mass
  in the front of the rocket can create a torque that steers the Rocket.


3.1 TODO Add pictures to the slides -- structure of modern Rocket, look more into how modern Rocket operates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


4 Scope
=======

  In this project we will focus on the Mathematical Formulation and the
  design of controller. We will build on a working quadcopter where all
  4 propellers will provide same constant thrust.


4.1 TODO Add quadcopter pics?

6 Tasks breakdown, potential challenges
=======================================

  1) Mathematical Formulation
     - Analysis of the system dynamic
     - How does a spinning mass create torque
     - How does the created torque affect the orientation of the system
     - The desired roll / pitch angle for system stability
     - The spinning mass dynamic
  2) Pick our components
     - Hackable Quadcopter
     - A motor with pulse control that we can make the spinning mass
       stay longer in one direction
     - What mass to attach? What arm to connect motor and mass?
     - Mechanical device that enable us to mount our system on the
       Quadcopter: MAY NEED 3D PRINTING
     - Microcontroller
     - IMU for sensor measurements
     - Wireless module for communication
     - Battery
  3) Simulation environment: maybe challenging because we working in 3D
     - Simulation in Matlab
     - State (orientation) estimation
     - How does motor inputs generate torque and in turn affect the
       orientation
     - Controller simulation
  4) Hack the quadcopter
     - Be able to control the 4 propellers using our wireless module
       thru our microcontroller
  5) Sensor Fusion
     - Configure the IMU, making use of accelerometer and gyroscope
     - Determine the rate of roll/pitch angle change
  6) Control circuit for motor
     - make sure the motor is doing what it is supposed to before
       mounting it on quadcopter
     - Design a test to show that the off-center mass is leaning on one
       side
  7) Putting it together
     - Integrate all our working components (wireless communication,
       motor pulse control, sensor fusion, simulation works)
     - Mount it on the quadcopter
  8) Controller Design
     - Real experimental results should be available since we already
       built our system and mount it on quadcopter
     - controls the input to the motor and the propellers, by taking in
       state estimation and sensor measurements
     - Responsible to achieve the desired roll/pitch angle to steer the
       vehicle
     - Moreover, to stabilize the quadcopter from a moving position.
  9) End-to-End testing
  10) Documentation

7.1 TODO Create a Gantt chart based on the above table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


8 Expected Conclusion
=====================

  We would like to conclude that a off center spinning mass is able to
  steer the quadcopter using the system's dynamic; and that such
  principle can be apply on Rocket for more effective way of stering a
  rocket.
